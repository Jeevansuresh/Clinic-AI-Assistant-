**Problem Overview**

India has over 70,000 private clinics, and Chennai alone has more than 3,000. Most of these are small or single-doctor practices that lack hospital management systems, receptionists, or any kind of AI support. These clinics still depend on:

* Phone calls that often go unanswered
* Paper records that can be misplaced
* Memory-based scheduling and follow-ups

This leads to critical inefficiencies:

* Missed appointments
* Lost or untracked reports
* Poor patient retention due to lack of reminders or post-care follow-up

Clinics often don't realize how much they are losing in time, money, and trust by not being digitized.

**Real-World Consequences**

A missed call equals a lost appointment. Every missed appointment leads to lost revenue, reduced patient trust, and a missed opportunity to provide care.

**The Solution: Clinic AI Assistant**

Our project reimagines the role of digital healthcare in India’s most underserved sector — small clinics. With no need for expensive software or infrastructure, the Clinic WhatsApp AI Assistant puts powerful automation in the hands of every neighborhood doctor using just WhatsApp.

By combining conversational AI, secure data management, and an intuitive doctor dashboard, we help clinics:

* Schedule, manage, and monitor appointments seamlessly
* Engage patients through personalized follow-ups
* Automate frequently asked questions and reduce staff burden

This solution bridges the gap between affordability and functionality in India's healthcare ecosystem.

**Program Explanation**

The system starts when a patient messages the clinic’s official WhatsApp number. A chatbot built using Twilio's WhatsApp API handles this conversation. The chatbot can understand messages, reply to FAQs, schedule or cancel appointments, and collect documents like prescriptions.

The chatbot also understands patient queries and helps them book appointments automatically based on doctor availability.

All patient data, messages, appointment details, and uploaded files are stored in a MySQL database. Flask handles the backend API calls, connecting the chatbot to the database and the doctor dashboard.

Doctors can log into a secure dashboard built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Here, they can view appointments for the day, see a weekly schedule, access uploaded reports, check patient history, and explore insights generated by the AI module (Ollama Mistral). These insights help them understand trends like missed follow-ups or frequently reported symptoms.

The AI assistant also sends personalized health tips to patients after appointments, increasing post-care engagement without extra effort from the doctor.
