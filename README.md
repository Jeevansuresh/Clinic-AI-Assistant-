**Problem Overview**

India has over 70,000 private clinics, and Chennai alone has more than 3,000. Most of these are small or single-doctor practices that lack hospital management systems, receptionists, or any kind of AI support. These clinics still depend on:

* Phone calls that often go unanswered
* Paper records that can be misplaced
* Memory-based scheduling and follow-ups

This leads to critical inefficiencies:

* Missed appointments
* Lost or untracked reports
* Poor patient retention due to lack of reminders or post-care follow-up

Clinics often don't realize how much they are losing in time, money, and trust by not being digitized.

---

**Real-World Consequences**

A missed call equals a lost appointment. Every missed appointment leads to lost revenue, reduced patient trust, and a missed opportunity to provide care.

**The Solution: ClinicAI**

Our project reimagines the role of digital healthcare in India’s most underserved sector — small clinics. With no need for expensive software or infrastructure, the Clinic WhatsApp AI Assistant puts powerful automation in the hands of every neighborhood doctor using just WhatsApp.

By combining conversational AI, secure data management, and an intuitive doctor dashboard, we help clinics:

* Schedule, manage, and monitor appointments seamlessly
* Engage patients through personalized follow-ups
* Automate frequently asked questions and reduce staff burden

This solution bridges the gap between affordability and functionality in India's healthcare ecosystem.

**Program Explanation**

The system starts when a patient messages the clinic’s official WhatsApp number. A chatbot built using Twilio's WhatsApp API handles this conversation. The chatbot can understand messages, reply to FAQs, schedule or cancel appointments, and collect documents like prescriptions.

The chatbot also understands patient queries and helps them book appointments automatically based on doctor availability.

All patient data, messages, appointment details, and uploaded files are stored in a MySQL database. Flask handles the backend API calls, connecting the chatbot to the database and the doctor dashboard.

Doctors can log into a secure dashboard built with HTML, JavaScript, and Tailwind CSS. Here, they can view appointments for the day, see a weekly schedule, access uploaded reports, check patient history, and explore insights generated by the AI module (Ollama Mistral). These insights help them understand trends like missed follow-ups or frequently reported symptoms.

The AI assistant also sends personalized health tips to patients after appointments, increasing post-care engagement without extra effort from the doctor.

**Impact Statement**

This assistant enables under-digitized clinics to:

* Reduce appointment losses
* Improve patient retention
* Automate repetitive tasks
* Deliver better care — using only WhatsApp

It acts as a smart virtual receptionist, helping clinics function more efficiently without changing how they operate.

**Why It’s a Winning Hackathon Project**

* **Real Impact**: Addresses a deeply-rooted, high-volume problem in India’s healthcare system.
* **Practicality**: Works with what clinics already use — no app downloads, no learning curve.
* **Scalability**: Can be deployed across thousands of clinics with minimal friction.
* **Innovation**: Combines AI, automation, and WhatsApp — tools rarely used together in this space.
* **Sustainability**: Doctors save time, patients stay informed, and clinics grow — all while keeping costs low.

Clinic WhatsApp AI Assistant isn’t just a project — it’s a leap forward for grassroots healthcare in India.

-- Step 1: Create the database
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS clinic_db;

-- Step 2: Use the database
USE clinic_db;

-- Step 3: Drop tables if they exist (for clean setup)
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS appointments;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS doctor_schedule;

-- Step 4: Create the doctor_schedule table
CREATE TABLE doctor_schedule (
    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    doctor_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    day VARCHAR(10) NOT NULL,         -- Example: Monday, Tuesday
    date DATE NOT NULL,               -- Specific date
    time_slot TIME NOT NULL,          -- Example: 09:00:00
    availability_status VARCHAR(20)   -- Available / Blocked / Not Available
);

-- Step 5: Create the appointments table
CREATE TABLE appointments (
    appointment_number INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    patient_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    doctor_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    issue VARCHAR(255),
    appointment_day VARCHAR(10),
    appointment_date DATE,
    appointment_time TIME,
    status VARCHAR(20)                -- Booked / Cancelled / Completed
);

-- Step 6: Sample data for doctor_schedule
INSERT INTO doctor_schedule (doctor_name, day, date, time_slot, availability_status)
